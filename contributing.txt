=== Contributing ===

This file is for any notes aimed at developers of Tabulate.

== Revision Control ==

We develop in Git, using Github at https://github.com/tabulate/tabulate

Stable tags are committed to the Subversion repository, which is only used as a
deployment system: trunk is stable, the `branches` directory is not used, and
the `tags` directory is a mirror of the Git tags.

== Version numbers ==

Tabulate follows the Semantic Versioning guidelines: http://semver.org/

The version number is hard-coded at two places in `tabulate.php`. It would also
be in `readme.txt` but trunk is stable so there's no need to specify a stable
tag.
